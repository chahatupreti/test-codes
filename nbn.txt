Found loss of in !series_summary	"loss of function of dystonin cytoskeletal linker proteins causes neurodegeneration in the sensory ataxia, dystonia musculorum (dt).  while much investigation has focused on understanding dt pathology, divergent functions of dystonin isoforms are still unknown.  here, we highlight a novel function of the dystonin-a2 isoform in mediating microtubule (_8MILLION8_) stability, golgi organization and flux through the secretory pathway.  using dystonin-null mice combined with isoform-specific loss of function analysis, we find dystonin-a2 is bound to map1b in the area surrounding the centrosome, where it maintains _8MILLION8_ acetylation. in dt, the absence of the map1b-dystonin-a2 interaction results in a loss of map1b perinuclear localization, leading to _8MILLION8_ deacetylation and instability.  deacetylated mts lead to golgi fragmentation and prevent anterograde trafficking of motor proteins.  maintenance of _8MILLION8_ acetylation through tsa administration or map1b overexperssion in vitro, mitigates the observed defect.  these aberrations are apparent in pre-phenotype dorsal root ganglia (drg) and primary sensory neurons, suggesting they are causal in the dt disorder."

Found treated in !series_summary	"silencing of genes that suppress the malignant phenotype by dna methylation spurred an interest in the clinical use of epigenetic reprogramming agents. single therapy is unlikely to be curative in the context of a heterogeneous disease such as diffuse large b cell lymphomas (dlbcl). the combination of dna demethylating drugs could increase the chance to respond to classical and new treatments. we found that dlbcl cell lines respond heterogeneously to dna demethylating agents. in sensitive cell lines, 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine induced a genomic signature similar to that of doxorubicin, the most important drug of the combinatorial chemotherapy regimen for dlbcl treatment. accordingly, the combination of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine and doxorubicin proved to be synergistic in cell killing in vitro and in vivo for dlbcl cell lines individually responsive to these drugs. in doxorubicin resistant cell lines, long-term exposure to low-dose of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine induces dna demethylation and subsequent doxorubicin sensitization in vitro and in vivo. this later effect correlates with _8MILLION8_ demethylation. _8MILLION8_ is epigenetically silenced in doxorubicin-resistant dlbcl cells and dlbcl patients with poor prognostic. in addition, we found that dna demethylating agents can sensitize primary dlbcl cells to doxorubicin. primary cells obtained from a dlbcl patient treated with 5-azacytidine shows _8MILLION8_ demethylation and ex vivo sensitization to multiple drugs. therefore, dna demethylating drugs can reprogram otherwise resistant dlbcl cells to respond to chemotherapy agents without increasing the toxicity to normal tissues. our data also indicate that dna methylation and consequent suppression of _8MILLION8_ expression represent a previously undescribed molecular mechanism of chemoresistance in dlbcl that can be further exploit for therapy."
